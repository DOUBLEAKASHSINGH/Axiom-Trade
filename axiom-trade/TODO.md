# TODO: Make Searchbar and Perpetuals Work

- [x] Add state for search query and active tab (Spot/Perpetuals) in TokenTable.tsx
- [x] Implement search functionality: Filter tokens based on pair name matching the search query
- [x] Implement Perpetuals tab: Create a new API endpoint /api/perpetuals or mock different data for Perpetuals mode
- [x] Update button interactions: Make Spot and Perpetuals buttons toggle the active tab
- [ ] Test the functionality by running the app and verifying search and tab switching
